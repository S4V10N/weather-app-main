## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS custom properties**  
- **Flexbox**  
- **CSS Grid**  
- **SCSS**  
- **JavaScript**  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

The Frontend Mentor Challenge taught me a lot. I discovered new ways to approach **JavaScript**, became more flexible with design choices, and improved my problem-solving process in code.  

Most importantly, it pushed me outside of my comfort zone â€” and I can genuinely say I grew as a developer through the experience. ðŸš€  

### Code snippets Iâ€™m proud of

**Loading animation (HTML):**
```html
<div class="loading load-state" id="load-state-animation">
  <div class="balls">
    <div class="ball-1"></div>
    <div class="ball-2"></div>
    <div class="ball-3"></div>
  </div>
  <p>Loading...</p>
</div>
```

**weather app dashboard (CSS):**
```CSS
.app__dashboard {
  width: 124rem;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 80rem 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  align-items: start;
  column-gap: 2.5rem;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "one two"
    "three two"
    "four two";
}
```

**weekday dropdown (JS):**
``` JS
weekDaysArray.forEach((dayElement, index) => {
  dayElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
    let selected = weekDaysArray[index];
    daysBtn.innerHTML = selected.textContent;
  });
});
```
